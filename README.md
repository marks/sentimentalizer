Sentimentalizer
===============

Sentiment analysis service unashamedly ripped off of [Sentan](https://github.com/martinrue/Sentan).

There are currently 2 flavours of this implementation - a .NET/Mono version and a Ruby version.

The mono version is built using

- Mono (xsp, xbuild)
- TinyWeb
- Sentan

The ruby version is built using

- Ruby
- Sinatra

Currently the Ruby version return less data to the front end (this is intentional)
